    """Darts is a competitive sport in which two players take alternating turns
    throwing three darts at a dartboard. The game is highly analytical, as
    tournaments and rankings rely heavily on scores, averages, and overall
    statistics. Numerous websites and analysts track the sport by gathering
    extensive numerical data, monitoring the throws across multiple matches,
    and covering the latest news and developments within the darts community.
    
    The dartboard is split up like a pizza of 20 slices, wherein these slices 
    have two large fields (single fields) along with smaller double and triple 
    fields that multiply the respective number's value. At the center of the 
    board, there are two circular target areas: the outer bull, worth 25 
    points, and the inner bullseye, worth 50 points. The bullseye functions as 
    the board's double for the bull. The triple 20, with its 60 points, is the 
    highest score on the board. This means the highest score to be reached 
    with three darts is 180.
    
    Matches are structured in different ways depending on the event. The "
    "leg-format we focused on lets players compete to win a predetermined "
    "number of legs, e.g., best of 11 legs, meaning the first to six wins. "
    "Within a leg, the players start with a score of 501 and aim to reduce it "
    "to exactly zero, finishing with a double. The highest value to do a "
    "checkout with (finish a leg) is 170. This concept makes players have to "
    "calculate their next throwing options to check out efficiently. The "
    "bullseye with its 50 points is the highest double field for a checkout, "
    "which doesn't mean that it is targeted the most to finish a leg. A "
    "player's checkout quota is another crucial statistic in darts, representing "
    "the percentage of times a player successfully finishes a leg when given "
    "the opportunity. A high checkout percentage indicates a player's "
    "efficiency in closing out legs under pressure.
    
    Over the course of a match, the average points a player throws with one "
    "dart is calculated. Averages are one of the most critical statistics in "
    "darts. The primary metric used is the three-dart average, which is "
    "calculated by dividing a player's total points scored in a throw by 3 "
    "(number of darts in a throw). This gives an indication of a player's "
    "overall scoring efficiency and consistency. A high three-dart average is "
    "a strong indicator of skill, as it reflects a player's ability to hit "
    "high-scoring targets consistently while maintaining accuracy. Professional "
    "players often maintain averages above 90, with the elite players "
    "frequently surpassing 100.
    
    Darts players earn rankings throughout various tournaments, accumulating "
    "points based on results. The most known ranking is the PDC Order of Merit. "
    "In this, a player's rank is determined by prize money earned over the "
    "last two years in ranking events."""

    """This data science project focuses on darts and aims to transform raw "
    "data into structured datasets suitable for visualization and analysis. "
    "The goal is to answer predefined research questions by gathering data "
    "from multiple sources, processing it, and generating analytical datasets.
    
    The project began with formulating research questions, ensuring they were "
    "answerable with the available data (looking ahead at available data "
    "sources), and prioritizing those that were the most interesting and "
    "meaningful. After defining these questions, relevant data sources were "
    "identified. Since existing APIs did not provide sufficient information, "
    "web scraping was necessary. The data was acquired from several sources, "
    "including:
    - Darts Orakel: https://app.dartsorakel.com/
    - Mastercaller PDC World Championship: "
    "https://mastercaller.com/tournaments/pdc-world-championship/

    - Flashscore: https://www.flashscore.de/
    
    These sources provided a comprehensive range of information, from "
    "historical match results and official player statistics to tournament "
    "formats and prize money distributions.
    
    The data pipeline followed a structured process, including acquisition, "
    "processing, transformation, visualization, and analysis. The first stage, "
    "data acquisition, involved extracting player statistics, match results, "
    "and other relevant information through multiple web scraping programs. "
    "The data was manually validated to ensure completeness and correctness "
    "before storing it in structured CSV files."""
