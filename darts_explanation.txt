Darts is a competitive sport in which two players, or two teams of two players each, take turns throwing three darts at a dartboard. The game is highly analytical, as tournaments and rankings
rely heavily on scores, averages, and overall statistics. Numerous websites and analysts track the sport by gathering extensive numerical data, monitoring players' averages across multiple
matches, and covering the latest news and developments within the darts community.

The dartboard is split up like a pizza of 20 slices, wherein these slices have two large fields (single fields) along with smaller double and triple fields (double and triple fields) that
multiply the respective number's value. At the center of the board, there are two circular target areas: the outer bull, worth 25 points, and the inner bullseye, worth 50 points. The bullseye
functions as the board's double for the outer bull.

The bullseye with it's 50 points is the highest scoring field for a single throw, while the triple 20 with it's 180 points is the highest score you can throw with all three darts in a round.

Matches are structured in different ways depending on the event. The leg-format lets players compete to win a predetermined number of legs e.g. best of 11 legs, meaning the first to six wins.
In the sets-format on the other hand, the players must win a certain number of sets, with each set consisting of a specific number of legs e.g. best of five sets, each set being first to three
legs. Players start with a score of 501 and aim to reduce it to exactly zero, finishing with a double or a "check-out". A player can reach this check-out as soon as he is at 170 points. This
conzept makes competitors have to calculate their best scoring options to check out efficiently.

Over the course of a match, the average points a player throws with one dart is calculated. Averages are one of the most critical statistics in darts. The primary metric used is the three-dart
average, which is calculated by dividing a player's total points scored by the number of darts thrown, then multiplying by three. This gives an indication of a playerâ€™s overall scoring
efficiency and consistency. A high three-dart average is a strong indicator of skill, as it reflects a player's ability to hit high-scoring targets consistently while maintaining accuracy.
Professional players often maintain averages above 90, with the elite players frequently surpassing 100.

Darts players earn rankings through their performances in various tournaments, accumulating points based on results. The most prestigious rankings include:
PDC Order of Merit: Determined by prize money earned over two years in ranking events.
WDF Rankings: Used in the World Darts Federation system for qualification in their major events.
