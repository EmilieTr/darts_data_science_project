Darts is a competitive sport, in which two players (or two teams of each two players) throw darts at a dartboard. This dartboard is split up like a pizza of 20 slices, wherein these slices have two big fields (single fields) and
two smaller fields (double and triple fields). In the middle lay two circles, where the outer one count for 25 points, and the inner one is that fields double field, making it 50 points and a "bulls-eye".
