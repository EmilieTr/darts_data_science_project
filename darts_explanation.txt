Darts is a highly analytical competitive sport, as tournaments and rankings heavily rely on scores, averages, and overall statistics. Numerous websites and analysts track the sport by gathering extensive numerical data, monitoring the throws across matches, and covering news and developments within the darts community.

Game Basics and Dartboard Structure:
Two players take alternating turns throwing three darts at a dartboard.
This circular board is divided into 20 numbered pizza slices, where each slice has:
- Two large single fields
- A smaller double field (worth double the number’s value)
- A smaller triple field (worth triple the number’s value)
In the middle are two small circles known as the bullseye:
- An outer bull with 25 points
- An inner bullseye with 50 points (functions as a double)

Match Structure:
This varies depending on the event. The here analysed leg format entails:
- players competing to win a set number of legs (e.g., best of 11 legs means first to 6 wins)
- each leg starting at 501 points, and players aiming to reduce it to exactly zero, finishing with a double, called the check out throw
- the highest checkout (finish) being 170 (e.g., Triple 20 → Triple 20 → Bullseye)

Checkout Strategy & Statistics:
Players calculate their throws to finish efficiently. The bullseye (50 points) is the highest double field, but not always the most used to finish.
Check out percentage:
- the percentage of times a player successfully finishes a leg when given the opportunity
- shows a player’s ability to close out legs under pressure

Highest Possible Scores:
- A triple 20 with 60 points (highest single dart score)
- therefore maximum with 3 darts: 180 points
Three-dart average:
- Mmasures a player's scoring efficiency and consistency
- Formula: Total points scored ÷ Total darts thrown × 3

Professional benchmarks:
- an average above 90 represents a solid professional level
- an average above 100 represents an elite level

Rankings & Tournaments:
Players earn rankings by accumulating points in tournaments.
- The PDC Order of Merit is the most well-known ranking system.
- Ranks are determined by prize money earned over the last two years in ranking events.
