Darts is a competitive sport in which two players take alternating turns throwing three darts at a dartboard. The game is highly analytical, as tournaments and rankings
rely heavily on scores, averages, and overall statistics. Numerous websites and analysts track the sport by gathering extensive numerical data, monitoring the throws across multiple
matches, and covering the latest news and developments within the darts community.

The dartboard is split up like a pizza of 20 slices, wherein these slices have two large fields (single fields) along with smaller double and triple fields that
multiply the respective number's value. At the center of the board, there are two circular target areas: the outer bull, worth 25 points, and the inner bullseye, worth 50 points. The bullseye
functions as the board's double for the bull.

(The bullseye with it's 50 points is the highest double field for checkout), while the triple 20 with it's 60 points is the highest score so you can throw a maximum of 180 with all three darts at a throw.

Matches are structured in different ways depending on the event. The leg-format lets players compete to win a predetermined number of legs e.g. best of 11 legs, meaning the first to six wins. Within a leg, the players start with a score of 501 and aim to reduce it to exactly zero, finishing with a double. The hightest value where you can do a checkout (finish a leg) is 170. This concept makes competitors have to calculate their next throwing options to check out efficiently.
In the sets-format on the other hand, the players must win a certain number of sets, with each set consisting of a specific number of legs e.g. best of five sets, each set being first to three
legs. Team matches take only place in the World Cup where the two best players from a country throw alternating.

Over the course of a match, the average points a player throws with one dart is calculated. Averages are one of the most critical statistics in darts. The primary metric used is the three-dart
average, which is calculated by dividing a player's total points scored in a throw divided by 3 (number of dart in a throw). This gives an indication of a player’s overall scoring
efficiency and consistency. A high three-dart average is a strong indicator of skill, as it reflects a player's ability to hit high-scoring targets consistently while maintaining accuracy.
Professional players often maintain averages above 90, with the elite players frequently surpassing 100.

Darts players earn rankings throughout various tournaments, accumulating points based on results. The most known rankings is the PDC Order of Merit. In this, a player's rank is determined by
