Darts is a competitive sport, in which two players (or two teams of each two players) throw darts at a dartboard. It is the perfect game for analyses of numerical data, since the tournaments and rankings rely heavily on the scorings, it's averages, and overall statistics. There are several websites analysing the sport by gathering the plentiful numerical data, analysing the competitor's averages throughout and over several matches, and following the games politics and news.

The dartboard is split up like a pizza of 20 slices, wherein these slices have two big fields (single fields) and two smaller fields (double and triple fields). In the middle lay two circles, where the outer one count for 25 points, and the inner one is that fields double field, making it 50 points and a "bulls-eye".
