(This document is an organised overview over the information commented in the issue "Data 
Scouting Darts")

*	Development of tournaments

2.	How do the (average) winning scorings of tournaments/matches vary over the years? (line chart)
   Data Source:

Visualization: line graph over matches and overall avg. of winning scores (y) / over time (x)

5.	How does the price money and the amount of participants of tournaments vary over the years? (rewrite)
   Data Source:
   https://mastercaller.com/tournaments/pdc-world-championship/{year}

   Visualization: line graph over placements and overall price money (y) / over time (x)
   Visualization: stacked bar chart (placements on top of each other) and overall price money (y) / over time (x) (with an overlapping line chart of participants)
   Visualization: bar chart over participant amount (y) / over time (x)
   Visualization: line graph over placements and overall price money (y) / over time (x) with a second y-/x-axe for participants

*	Strategies and tactics

7.	In which countries are tournaments held and how does it influence singular participants if at all?

   https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDC_World_Darts_Championship

   Visualization: table of winner nationality and country of match held, absolute numbers of winners in cell
   -> Visualization: table of winner nationality and country of match held, conditional likeliness and manually assess for correlation

8.	How do team matches compare to single matches in their scores? (does it imply teammates dragging each other down or raising each other up?)
   Data Source:
   https://app.dartsorakel.com/tournament/stats/1095

   (files: person data, team match (world cup) check out scorings, single match check out scorings)
   Visualization: diverging bar chart over better scores in team / better scores in singles on axis amount of players, bars of nationality, averages
   Visualization: diverging bar chart over better scores in team / better scores in singles on axis amount of players, bars of nationality, check out percentage

9.	How likely is it to throw 180 points after there was another 180 points thrown?
   Data Source:
   https://www.flashscore.de/dart/welt/

   Visualization: / calculate one number and look at conditional likeliness (good for poster, maybe not for website), filter out situations where a 180 isn't able to be thrown

10.	How likely are participants to win a leg after throwing 180 points as first throw?

   Visualization: / calculate one number and look at conditional likeliness (good for poster, maybe not for website)

- 11.	Is it more likely to win a match if the participants scoring or check-out quota is better 
than the opponents?

- Visualization: / calculate one number and look at conditional likeliness (good for poster, maybe not for website), BIG CALCULATIONS

4.	What are the most popular double fields and what is the percentage to check them? (doubles are normally not thrown)
   Data Sources:
   https://app.dartsorakel.com/stats/double

   Visualization: line graph over top 5 check out scorings (several lines) and overall check out scoring (y) / over time (x) //
                  line graph over top 5 check out scorings (several lines) and overall check out percentage (y) / over time (x)
   Visualization: bar chart over check out percent (y) / check out scoring (x)
   Visualization: pie chart over participant percentage, which check out scorings they "prefer"
   Visualization: line graph over amount of check out scorings (y) thrown over the years (x)

13.	How likely is the participant to lose after throwing a 9 darter?

   Visualization: / calculate one number and look at conditional likeliness (good for poster, maybe not for website), check how many 9 darter are actually in our data

*	Players

1.	How do the 5/10/15 best player change from 2000/1995 to now? (averages vs. check-out quota)
   Data Source:
   https://app.dartsorakel.com/stats/player

   Visualizations: bar chart average / bar chart check out quota over the top 5 players 1995/2014 (x)

- 6.	How do the rankings vary over age, nationality and left/right handed people of participants?
      Data Source:
