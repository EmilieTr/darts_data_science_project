## **Presentation Structure**  

### **Introduction**  
### **Popular Double Fields**  
- *Transition:* "Darts is not just about hitting high scores; it is also about checking out efficiently. So, we also had a look at this statistical aspect of darts because that impacts the player's performance."

First Visualization:

- "This graph shows the distribution of all throws at double fields, indicating which doubles are targeted and hit most frequently."

- "As we see, D20, D16, D8 and D10 are the biggest segments."

Second Visualization:

- "This graph shows the distribution of how many players most frequently/prefer to target and hit each double field." 

- "A player must finish a leg by hitting a double, so the choice of double is strategic. Some doubles are favored because of their positioning and ease of adjustment if a player misses."  

- **D20** → One of the most popular finishing doubles due to its high position and familiarity.  
- **D16** → Preferred because missing still leaves a good option (D8).  
- **D10, D8** → Used by certain players for its straightforward path if a miss occurs.  

- *Effect:* "A player's ability to finish the leg on their preferred double efficiently can be the difference between winning and losing a match."

### **Rankings vs. Properties**  
- *Transition:* "Next, let’s look at the influence of different characteristics such as age, nationality, and handedness on rankings. Therefore, we chose the PDC Order of Merit as the underlaying ranking."  
  
First chart:

- "Distribution of different age groups across ranking positions over the years."

- "Most players in top ranking positions were between 30-40 or between 50-60 years old."

- "Reason: Players in their 30s have gained significant experience and skill, while those in their 50s may have been in the professional circuit for a long time, showing the longevity of certain players’ careers."

Second chart:

- "Distribution of nationalities."

- "There are many very good English players and the influence of fewer Dutch players, who have been very good for a long time."

- "Generally, darts has many players from Great Britain, and many of them are highly skilled."

- "Reason: The pub culture in the UK plays a big role, as darts is a popular pastime, allowing players to develop their skills from a young age in a competitive yet accessible environment."

Third chart:

- "Distribution of handedness."

- "As expected, there are significantly more right-handed players than left-handed players."

### **Player Stats**  
- *Transition:* "Finally, let’s break down some of the most important statistics that define a player's performance."  

- "First, we see some general information about the player itself."

Player focus: Rob Cross

- "We are focusing on the player Rob Cross today because of an interesting development that can be observed in his performance."

Development of throws and checkout percentages for individual double fields over the years:

- "The player consistently makes the most throws on D16, followed by D20, D18, and D8, which aligns with our expectations based on the double field analysis."

- "Of course, this can vary from player to player, as each player has their own preferences."

- "On the right, we can see that there is always a double field where the checkout percentage is above 45%, which means he can reliably count on it."

Detailed analysis of throw counts and checkout percentage for a specific double field:

- "Here, it is clear that the player notices when the checkout percentage of a double field is no longer as good, which leads to fewer throws on that field."

- "When he starts hitting said double more consistently again, the number of throws on that double increases."

Development of the player's average over the years:

- "The graph shows a consistently strong performance of over 96 points, except for a performance drop in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic."

- *Effect:* "By analyzing these stats, coaches and analysts can identify trends in a player's game, helping them improve their weaknesses and maximize their strengths."
