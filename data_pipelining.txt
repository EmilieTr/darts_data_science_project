## Data Pipeline
This data science project on the topic darts aims to transform raw data into structured datasets suitable for data visualization and analysis needed for answering the predefined reasearch questions.
This pipeline gathers data from multiple sources, processes it, and generates analytical datasets.

### Data Sources
The data for this project was acquired through web scraping, since existing APIs did not provide sufficient information:
- [Darts Orakel](https://app.dartsorakel.com/)
- [Mastercaller PDC World Championship](https://mastercaller.com/tournaments/pdc-world-championship/)
- [Dartn.de Professional Darts](https://www.dartn.de/Dart-Profis)
- [Wikipedia - Professional Darts Corporation](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Darts_Corporation)
- [Wikipedia - PDC World Darts Championship](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDC_World_Darts_Championship)
- [Flashscore](https://www.flashscore.de/)
These sources cover an wide array of information ranging from historical match results and official player statistics to tournament formats and prize money allocations.

### Pipeline Architecture
The data pipeline follows a structured process that includes data acquisition, processing, transformation, visualization, and analysis.

The first stage, data acquisition, involves extracting player statistics, match results etc. through several web scraping programs - one program for each research question.
To ensure the data is completely and correctly extracted, it was manually validated before storing the raw data in structured CSV files.

Next, during the data transformation phase, the extracted data undergoes cleaning and preprocessing, which includes checking for missing values effecting answering the research questions and
correcting errors in the corresponding web scraping program if necessary. This step ensured that the data is consistent and suitable for analysis.

We didn't need a specified modeling phase, since the datasets were structured inthemselves and in relation to each other from the get go, since it was know from the beginning which relationships and
patterns were to be looked at in the context of the research questions.  

Finally, the visualization phase involved creating graphical representations of the data for eacah research question. These visualizations are supposed to answer the reasearch questions presented on the
website and poster, not on their own but with text snippets explaining the context of the questions and the game itself.


### Pipeline Output

The pipeline generates structured datasets that serve different analytical purposes. Player performance profiles, tournament analysis structures, and historical trend data allow for in-depth exploration
of darts performance. Additionally, pre-aggregated datasets are prepared for facilitating data visualization and interactive analysis.  


### Implementation Details

The project is built on the Python ecosystem, leveraging Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical computations, and Scikit-learn for preprocessing. Visualization is handled using Matplotlib.
Data quality is ensured with Great Expectations for validation and Pandas Profiling for exploratory analysis. The workflow follows a structured execution flow, with script-based sequential
processing and modular functions for reusability and maintainability.  


### Execution Flow

The process begins with collecting raw data through web scraping, followed by data cleaning and standardization. Feature engineering is then applied to create insightful variables, and modeling
datasets are generated with appropriate partitioning. Finally, visualization-ready datasets are produced for analytical dashboards, ensuring a clear and structured approach to darts data analysis.

Data Pipeline for Analyzing Dart Double Fields
Research Question 4
The analysis focuses on identifying the most popular double fields in darts and determining the percentage of successful attempts to hit these doubles.

Data Source
The data was sourced from the Darts Orakel statistics platform (https://app.dartsorakel.com/stats/double), which provides comprehensive statistics on professional dart players'
performance on double fields.

Web Scraping Implementation
The web scraping process utilized Selenium and BeautifulSoup to extract structured data from the Darts Orakel website. The pipeline followed these steps:

Browser Automation Setup:

Configured Chrome WebDriver using Selenium to interact with the website
Implemented automatic WebDriver management with ChromeDriverManager


Data Filtering:

Set the date filter to January 1, 1994, to obtain historical data across multiple years
Created a function to extract available double types from the dropdown menu


Systematic Data Extraction:

Iterated through each double field type (D1 through D20)
Extracted player statistics tables for each double field
Implemented pagination handling to capture up to 9 pages of players per double type


Data Organization:

Stored extracted data in pandas DataFrames with consistent structure
Added a "Double" column to identify which double field each record relates to
Combined all individual DataFrames into a comprehensive dataset


Data Export:

Saved the consolidated data to "question4.csv" for analysis and visualization



Data Analysis and Visualization
The resulting CSV file contains player performance data structured with these columns:

Rank: Player's ranking for that specific double
Player: Name of the dart player
Country: Nationality of the player
Hit: Number of successful hits on the double
Single: Number of times hitting the single field instead
Outside: Number of throws missing the board or hitting other segments
Other: Number of hits on other segments
Pcnt: Success percentage on that double
Double: The specific double field (D1-D20)




From the visualization in Image 2, we can interpret:

Distribution of Throws:

D20 is clearly the most frequently attempted double at 71.1% of all throws
D16 is the second most popular at 20.1%
D10, D8, and D18 are attempted significantly less often
All other doubles collectively make up just 1.2% of attempts


Distribution of Hits:

The success rate distribution closely mirrors the attempt distribution
D20 accounts for 72.0% of all successful doubles
D16 represents 20.4% of successful hits
The remaining doubles have minimal representation in successful hits



Key Findings

The double 20 (D20) is overwhelmingly the most popular double field to attempt, accounting for over 70% of all double attempts by professional players.
Double 16 (D16) is the clear second choice, representing approximately 20% of attempts.
There is a strong correlation between the frequency of attempts on a particular double and the proportion of successful hits on that same double.
The remaining double fields (D18, D10, D8, and others) collectively account for less than 10% of throws, indicating a strong preference among professional players for D20 and D16.
This data suggests that dart players follow established strategies for double selection rather than attempting all doubles with equal frequency.
