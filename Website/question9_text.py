The highest probabilities are in the UK Open (10.15%) and World Series Finals (10%)
The lowest probabilities are in European Tour 6 (4.95%) and the World Masters (5.88%)
Across tournaments, the probability ranges from about 5% to 10%.

This suggests there's only a modest "response effect" - players don't dramatically increase their chances of 
throwing a 180 just because their opponent did.

There's only a modest psychological or momentum effect when responding to an opponent's 180"""
