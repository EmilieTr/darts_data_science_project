The total prize pool has seen remarkable growth:

- Started at £64,000 in 1994
- Reached £1 million by 2010
- Peaked at £2.5 million in 2019 and has remained stable since

- £100,000 by 2006
- £250,000 by 2014
- £500,000 from 2019 onward

There's a clear correlation between participant numbers and prize money:

- Major increases in participants (1999, 2006, 2019) typically coincided with significant prize money increases
- The 2019 expansion to 96 participants aligned with the prize pool reaching its current £2.5 million
- Since 2019, both participant numbers and prize money have remained stable

The graphs show that while the total prize pool has increased, the distribution maintains a similar structure:

- Champion and runner-up consistently receive the largest portions
- Prize money decreases progressively across placement categories
- The introduction of new placement categories (Last 64 in 2006, Last 96 in 2019) reflects the expanding tournament format"""
