first_graph_5 = """The number of participants grew from 24 to 96 player, with significant expansions occurring 
around 1999, 2006, and 2019.

The total prize pool has seen remarkable growth:
- Started at £64,000 in 1994
- Reached £1 million by 2010
- Peaked at £2.5 million in 2019 and has remained stable since

There's a clear correlation between participant numbers and prize money: Major increases in participants 
(1999, 2006, 2019) typically coincided with significant prize money increases.

The graphs show that while the total prize pool has increased, the distribution maintains a similar structure:
- Champion and runner-up consistently receive the largest portions.
- Prize money decreases progressively across placement categories."""

dependence on the single placements."""

second_graph_5 = """The prize money increases for all placements. It is observable that the higher the placement,
the higher the increase of prize money in particular since 2010. So the difference from the last 96 to the first
place increases a lot."""
