first_graph_5 = """This number of participants grew from about 20 to nearly 100 players, with significant expansions occurring around 1999, 2006, and 2019.

The total prize pool has seen remarkable growth:

- Started at £64,000 in 1994
- Reached £1 million by 2010
- Peaked at £2.5 million in 2019 and has remained stable since

The winner's prize has followed a similar trajectory with numbers from under £500,000 in 2000 to £2.5 million by 2020.

(
There's a clear correlation between participant numbers and prize money: Major increases in participants (1999, 2006, 2019) typically coincided with significant
prize money increases.

The graphs show that while the total prize pool has increased, the distribution maintains a similar structure:
- Champion and runner-up consistently receive the largest portions.
- Prize money decreases progressively across placement categories.
