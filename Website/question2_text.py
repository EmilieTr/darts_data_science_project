first_graph_2 = """The World Championship scores demonstrate greater volatility, with notable peaks around 2010 
and 2017-2018 where scores exceeded 106. All lines generally show an upward trend over time, which could be seen
because of the increasing regression line which can be faded in above.
The average scores generally range between 94 and 105, with a 
few notable exceptions. These entail a significant spike around 2017 for World Championship score, reaching 
above 105 which was an outstanding tournament by Michael van Gerwen.
The averages of the World Grand Prix are lower than the ones of the other tournaments because is has a special 
modus where it is a lot harder to reach a high average.
The wider range of the standard deviation (which can be faded in above) is because the all tournaments except
the World Grand Prix are slightly at the same height but only the average of the World Grand Prix is a lot lower.

This validates the assumption the research came into existence with:
The sport matures with time, making the standards for skill of the players rise and rise over the time."""

roughly normal distribution ranging from about 92 to 107 points."""
