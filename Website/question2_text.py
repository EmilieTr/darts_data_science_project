and all major tournaments has widened slightly in recent years (2022-2025).> kann vielleicht raus)
The average scores generally range between 94 and 105, with a few notable exceptions. These entail a significant spike around 2015-2016 for World Championship scores,
reaching above 105 and a noticeable dip in both averages around 2002-2003.

This validates the assumption the research came into existence with:
The sport matures with time, making the standards for skill of the players rise and rise to a not-defined limit."""
