explanation_4 = """As seen in the explanation of the game on the homepage, a leg ends by hitting a double field, 
called a check out. With these come the statistics of the check out percentage. Other than in the check outs, 
doubles are usually not targeted."""

fields."""

first_graph_4 = """The most attempted double fields are the D20 (14.8%), D16 (11.3%), D10 (11.0%), D8 (10.3%) and 
D18 (7.22%). The most successfully hitted double fields are the D20 (24.7%), D10 (19.0%), D16 (12.7%), D8 (9.38%) 
and D12 (5.92%).

This shows that D20, D16, D10, and D8 are consistently among the most popular double fields for both attempts and 
successful hits. This makes sense, since if a throw on D20 or D16 fails, the player can target the double field 
with the value half as big as D10 or D8 to finish the leg with a check out."""

second_graph_4 = """The most player's frequently thrown double field is the D20 for 71.1% of the players. The second 
favorite double field is the D16 for 20.1%. This can also be explained with the principle that most
players throw on the D20 and D16 because then, they can easily throw on D10 or D8 next if they miss the first throw
without ending on an odd number which they could not check with one dart."""
