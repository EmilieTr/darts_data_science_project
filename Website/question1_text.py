the second ranking because a long time Phil Taylor was a lot better than the other player and only over the time,
other very strong player occured.
In the meantime, the performance of the player is more balanced which means that there are a lot more really good
players and the overall standard in darts increased in the last years. Aside from that, the overall performance 
does not only depends on the averages anymore because the influence of the checkout percantage, the timing and the 
consistence through the year, is getter more and more important."""

second_graph_1 = """There are some interesting patterns seen in this diagram:
There is a consistent improvement through 2010-2015 except the drop in 2014 which can not be explained. 
The average is relatively stable on a high performance (97.0-98.0) since 2015 on a higher level than in the early
years. The decrease since 2017 can be explained because through the years, a lot more players are on the tour but
they are not always very good. The peak in 2021 is because of the Corona pandemic because in this year, only a few
tournaments was held and therefore it is not that scattered and there is less underlaying data."""

general_1 = """In general we can say that the average performance metrics have increased significantly from 2009 to 2024, with approximately
a 7-10 point improvement in averages across all ranking positions.

The data also suggests that the gap between top-ranked and lower-ranked players has decreased over time.

The sport has become more consistent in general as seen in significant improvements between 2009-2017 and seemingly performance metrics stabilized in
recent years (2019-2024), suggesting the sport may have reached a certain maturity level.

The checkout percentages have also become more uniform across different ranking positions, indicating more consistent finishing skills throughout the
professional ranks."""
