the second ranking, since for a long time Phil Taylor was a lot better than the other players and only with time,
other players able to compete came along.
In the mean time, the performance of players is more balanced, which means that there are a lot more really good
players and the overall standard in darts increased in the last years. Aside from that, the overall performance 
does not only depend on the averages anymore, because the influence of the checkout percentage, the timing and the 
consistency through the years is becoming more and more important."""

second_graph_1 = """There are some interesting patterns seen in this diagram:
There is a consistent improvement through 2010-2015 except the drop in 2014 which can not be explained. 
The average is relatively stable on a high performance (97.0-98.0) since 2015 on a higher level than in the early
years. The decrease since 2017 can be explained by there being a lot more players throughout the years, which 
doesn't necessarily mean they're very good. The data also suggests that the gap between top-ranked and lower-ranked 
players has decreased over time, suggesting the sport may have reached a certain maturity level.
The peak in 2021 is because of the Corona pandemic since in that year, only a few
tournaments were held and therefore the data is not as consistent."""

In the fewer years, there was more variability in checkout percentages based on rank (checkout percentage decreased
with the rank). In the last years, the checkout percentages have become more consistent across ranks (around 41%).
The total checkout percentage also increased (rank 1 players had higher checkout percentages in 2012 than in 2024).
Lower-ranked players have also improved their checkout percentages compared to 2012.
The checkout percentages have also become more uniform across different ranking positions, indicating more 
consistent finishing skills throughout the professional ranks."""

explained because in the early analysed years, there were less player but the few good players' with good checkout
percentages had an big influence on the average of this years. In the meantime, there are a lot more player with a 
high checkout percentages but there are also a lot more player, so the average didn't change that much."""
