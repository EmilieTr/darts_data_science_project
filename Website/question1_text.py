a 7-10 point improvement in averages across all ranking positions.

The data also suggests that the gap between top-ranked and lower-ranked players has decreased over time.

The sport has become more consistent in general as seen in significant improvements between 2009-2017 and seemingly performance metrics stabilized in
recent years (2019-2024), suggesting the sport may have reached a certain maturity level.

The checkout percentages have also become more uniform across different ranking positions, indicating more consistent finishing skills throughout the
professional ranks."""
