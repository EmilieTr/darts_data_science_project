first_description_10 = """The table shows the number of total legs that has been started with a 180, the number of 
wins with the first throw as 180 and the probability of winning a leg with starting with 180."""

first_graph_10 = """The average win probability after starting with a 180 is quite high at 72.42%.
The highest win rates are in European Tour 13 and European Tour 2 (both 88.24%).
The lowest win rate is in the World Masters (50%) and in European Tour 11 (53.85%).

The most tournaments show win rates of 80% or higher after starting with a 180 at the first throw.
Starting a leg with a 180 gives players a significant advantage because after the 180 he has just 321 points left.
So it is quite understandable that the player has roughly a 3/4 chance of winning that leg."""

probabilities (which would follow a normal distribution) but there is no really peak at the average probability
and there are the hightest frequency in the range of the hightest probabilities.
This seems like the lower probabilities are unusual and exceptions while the higher probabilities are the normal
results that happen."""
