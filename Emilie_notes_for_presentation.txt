Presentation: Darts

Page: Homepage

Welcome to our website on the topic of darts.
This is our homepage, where you can find an introduction to the topic, a general description of the game, and explanations of important terms. 
Tyra has already explained the most important terms to you.
We have divided the topic into three overlapping categories. We start with the broader context, move on to questions about individual games, and finally, 
we take a closer look at specific players. For each of these categories, we have formulated three research questions, which you can see here and navigate 
through using our legend.
We will not present each research question in detail but will instead give you an overview of the development and characteristics of darts.
Over time, darts has gained increasing attention and relevance. This is clearly reflected in the growth of participant numbers and prize money.


Page: Prize money and Participants

We analyzed the development of prize money and number of participants based on the World Championship, and in both cases, we observed a significant increase. 
The prize money is aggregated in this chart, allowing us to view the total prize pool. In the chart below, you can also see the distribution of prize money 
across different ranking positions, which reveals that the top players in the World Championship have experienced a substantial prize money growth over the years.
We also asked ourselves whether the increasing popularity of darts is reflected in the players' performance.


Page: Averages

To investigate this, we examined the evolution of average scores in various tournaments over the years. You can select which tournaments you want to analyze, 
out of a selection of the major darts tournaments. Additionally, you can choose whether to display a regression line and standard deviation, either for the selected 
tournaments only or for all tournaments combined.
The chart currently displays the development of the "World Championship" and "World Matchplay" tournaments, as well as an average across all tournaments and a regression 
line for all tournaments. Again, we observe an upward trend.
In summary, darts has become increasingly popular: more people are participating, more prize money is available, and the overall skill level is rising over time. 

Next, we will take a deeper dive and analyze specific characteristics of darts matches.
